why Nikitopulos' works: m-dim, square BUT sing < nrow = ncol:
sq => Vk = v_sing as in 1-dim case
maybe sing < nrow implies condition nrow < ncol satisfied

(after s8(8x8) -> 0)
min.sing7(7x8 submat) reduces s7(8x8) a little in best case
                      incr. s8(8x8)
to avoid cross-over, when s7,s8(8x8) close-by then use tniki:s7(8x8)
overall very small convergence

10/6/99
reduce s7(7x8) by acting only on parameters of symmetric part
after s8(8x8) -> 0: again, s7(8x8) not affected, may increase
11/6/99
observe that submat 2..7 cant reduce s6(7x7)
whereas submat 1..6 reduces s6(7x7) rapidly
coz 1st special?
